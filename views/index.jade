            p
              | We met through the Internet. Back when I was blogging at ibankcoin.com his brother read my posts, and we became friends. His brother introduced us after he heard about my idea of a real-time social stock-trading platform.             
            p
              |It’s been a long road, and we’ve worked countless hours. Sometimes Shark will stay up all weekend to make a piece of code work. I’ve had to try and give myself a crash course in everything web development and web design.  We telecommunicate from San Francisco and New York.

            p
              | I grew up in Marin County, CA. I joined the army as soon as I could, and left for basic training a week after turning 18. After basic and Airborne School, I went to Fort Bragg, NC, where I was an airborne infantryman in the 82nd Airborne Division. I completed two tours in Iraq, one during the invasion, which I left for only 28 days after arriving at Bragg.           
            p
              | I have a degree in Finance, and thought I wanted to be an analyst, trader, what have you, but that’s not what I want to do. I want to build tech companies, especially veteran spawned tech companies. If I can make a decent idea come to life with near perfect execution, and create actual value along the way, then that is all I ever want to do. I just want to make “cool stuff” that also improves lives, and returns value to the community.
            p
              | There are not enough veterans in tech, and I hope to change that.
